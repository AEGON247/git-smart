**Tired of the repetitive `git checkout main`, `git pull`, `git checkout feature`, `git rebase main` dance?** `git-smart sync` automates syncing your feature branch with the default branch in one command.

## ü§î The Problem

Keeping your feature branches up-to-date with the latest changes from `main` (or `master`) is essential, but it's a tedious, multi-step process:

1.  `git stash` (if you have local changes)
2.  `git checkout main`
3.  `git pull`
4.  `git checkout your-feature-branch`
5.  `git rebase main`
6.  `git stash pop` (if you stashed)
7.  Resolve any conflicts...

It's easy to forget a step or make a mistake, especially when you're doing it multiple times a day.

## üéâ The Solution: `git-smart sync`

`git-smart` provides a single, intelligent command:

```bash
git-smart sync
````

It automatically handles the entire workflow for you:

  * Detects your default branch (`main` or `master`).
  * Stashes uncommitted changes safely.
  * Checks out and pulls the default branch.
  * Checks back out your original branch.
  * Rebases the default branch onto yours.
  * Applies your stashed changes.
  * Clearly reports conflicts if they occur.

Spend less time juggling Git commands and more time coding\!
